The IP addresses remain the same: the source address is the IP from the host that sent the message, and the destination address is the IP of the host that should receive the message. Every IP address is assumed to uniquely identify a host or router throughout the whole network. \\

The Ethernet addresses change at each hop, because those addresses are only used link-local. \\The destination Ethernet address of the packet captured at PC1 is the hardware address of PC2, and the source Ethernet address of the packet captured at PC4 is the hardware address of Router1. \\In the link between PC2 and Router1, the source address will be the hardware address of PC2 and the destination address will be the hardware address of Router1. So every time a router forwards a packet, it will use its own Ethernet address as the source and the Ethernet address of the next hop as the destination.
