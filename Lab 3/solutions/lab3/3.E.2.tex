The ICMP Echo Request message travels up to Router1.\\
This happens because PC1 has set PC2 as the default gateway, and PC2 has set Router1 as its default gateway. 
\\In the router, there is no default gateway and no other match for 10.0.10.110/X. Thus, a "Destination unreachable" ICMP packet is returned by the router.
