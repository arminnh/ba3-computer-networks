*** icmp en arp van pc4 ****

PC4 sends an ARP request to the router. 
If Proxy ARP is enabled in the router, the router will forward the ARP request to the PCs on the other subnet, and the router will respond to PC4 with its own MAC address, causing PC4 to map the destination IP address to the router's Ethernet address. Then, PC4 will send the pings desinted for PC1 to the router's Ethernet address, not being aware that isn't actually PC1. The router will then forward the pings to the other subnet, and they will successfully reach PC1.
If Proxy ARP is not enabled in the router, no packets or ARP requests will be forwarded to the other subnet and the result of pings will be \"Destination host unreachable\".
