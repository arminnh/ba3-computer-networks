traceroute sends packets with different time-to-live (TTL) to the destination, starting from TTL=1 and incrementing on each following packet. \\
The packet with TTL=1 will be decremented to 0 at the first hop it encounters (PC2 in this case), and it will return a "Time-to-live exceeded" ICMP message. \\
Each packet with initial TTL=n will reach one hop further than a packet with TTL=n-1. traceroute saves the source of every TTL exceeded message and considers it a hop.\\
A packet which reaches the destination will (hopefully) return a "Destination unreachable" message. This is because traceroute sends packets to "unlikely ports". These are ports which are unlikely to be in use.
