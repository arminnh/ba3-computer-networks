The network prefix is part of the IP addresses of all hosts in the same network.
An IP address is unique in this network, while the prefix can be seen as the \'range\' in which all IP addresses can be found. 
For example the prefix 192.0.1.0 with subnet mask 24 (255.255.255.0) corrsponds to all IP addresses 192.0.1.x with x ranging from 1-254, and broadcast on 255.

An IP address can be seen as a prefix with length (=subnet mask) equal to 32. This leaves but one specific address in the range.
