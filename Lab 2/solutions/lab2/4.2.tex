The loopback interface is the interface used by hosts to communicate with themselves. Therefore, every packet sent to the loopback interface is also received by the loopback interface. \\
This is not the case for interface "eth0". Thus, RX-OK and TX-OK are identical for interface lo but not for interface "eth0".
