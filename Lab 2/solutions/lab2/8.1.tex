With many hosts, the static mapping of hosts' addresses and names becomes impractical as there are many host files to update, each time a new host is introduced or removed.\\
Say there are 1000 hosts and a new host enters the network, each of those 1000 hosts' files should be updated for the network name resolving to become synchronised.\\ This synchronisation becomes too complex very fast.
