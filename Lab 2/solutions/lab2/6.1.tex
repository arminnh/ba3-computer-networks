In the PCAP dump we see that the ARP request gets duplicate replies.
However, the first host who replies has its MAC address saved in the local ARP table and is used for further messaging. \\ Even though there are duplicate IP addresses in the network, the MAC addresses are unique, so only one of the hosts will respond.
