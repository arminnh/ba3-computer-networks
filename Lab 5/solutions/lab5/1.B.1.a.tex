We can count 14 UDP packets in the data transfer. (We only consider UDP packets, since only they are part of the actual file transfer.) Only one packet per UDP datagram was transmitted; there was no fragmentation.
We see three different UDP datagrams, their difference lies in the payload: \\

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
    \hline
    Amount of packets & Payload length \\ \hline
    1 & 4 \\ \hline
    10 & 1024 \\ \hline
    3 & 4 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
