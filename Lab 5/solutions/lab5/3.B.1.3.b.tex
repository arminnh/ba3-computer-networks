Only when an intermediary hop is causing a ``bottleneck'' for a packet to be forwarded due to its MTU being exceeded will there be any ICMP error messages: the hosts themselves have knowledge of their own MTUs and based on those, the MSS is negotiated in the three way handshake. We see in this case that the MSS is 460. \\

\iffalse
This size is respected by all of the packets in the nttcp transmission, so no ICMP error message was generated. \\

The DF-bit is set in the IP datagrams.
