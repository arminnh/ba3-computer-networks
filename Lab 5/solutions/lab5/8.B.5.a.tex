At first, the sender sends 10 packets, so the cwnd is set to 10 initially. When a first ACK is received, two packets are sent because the cwnd grew by 1. Then, 3 ACKs are received more or less at the same time, and 6 packets are sent out: the cwnd just grew by 3. This behavior is characterized by slow start.
