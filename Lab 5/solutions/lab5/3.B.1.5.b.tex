The ICMP error messages are used for Path MTU Discovery to reduce the TCP transmission's MSS value and send smaller packets. \\

We see this in packets 45, 47 and 48 in the file ``Lab 5/traces/3.B.PC1.pcap'': \\
\begin{itemize}
    \item packet 45 is a TCP packet sent by PC1 with a payload of 1024 bytes, which exceeds PC3's MTU. \\
    \item PC1 then receives packet 47 from PC3, which is the ICMP error message. \\
    \item packet 48 is a TCP packet sent by PC1 with a smaller payload of 500 bytes.
\end{itemize}
