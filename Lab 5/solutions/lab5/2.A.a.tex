FTP: 28 -> 789 (22.95 -> 24.13) => 1.18 seconds

TFTP: 824 -> 4952 (406.71 -> 408.37) => 1.66 seconds \\
TFTP: 4955 -> 9083 (415.80 -> 417.44) => 1.64 seconds

We see that, indeed, FTP outperforms TFTP.
The size of the data in FTP data packets ranges from 1448 bytes to 7240 bytes. In the TFTP packets this is 512 bytes (and 350 bytes for the last packet). \\

Since TCP operates a sliding window for acknowledgements, the FTP sender doesn't have to wait for every packet's ACK before sending the next packet. Only when the delay of ACKs is large enough (determined by the sliding window parameters) the sender will start retransmitting packets. \\
With TFTP, the sender \emph{does} have to wait for the ACK of every packet, so, every time a packet is sent after the receiver has received the packet, no data is sent while the ACK is traveling back to the sender.
