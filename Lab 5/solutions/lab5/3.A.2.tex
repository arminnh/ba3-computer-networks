At -l1473, fragmentation starts, and continues to happen until -l65507. \\ 
After -l65508, there is no fragmentation, as the packet is not sent at all anymore. \\
This happens because the limit for the data length for IPv4 is 65507 bytes ( = 64kB - 8 byte UDP header - 20 byte IP header).

In ``Lab 5/traces/3.A.PC1.pcap'', we captured the transmissions in following order: -l1024, -l1072. -l1073, -l65507, -l65508
