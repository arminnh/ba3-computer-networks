source port: 40951, destination port: 5038 \\

We notice that port 4444 is not in these packets. That port is used by the TCP packets sent by nttcp to set up the connection.
For the transmitted UDP packets, we believe that a random source port is selected randomly from a range of ports that are not assinged to a particular application layer protocol. In fact, the port that was used, 40951, is indeed unassigned according to this web page: http://whatismyipaddress.com/port-list
