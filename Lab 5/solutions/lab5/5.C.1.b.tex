We do see delayed acknowledgements, which is not abnormal.\\
It could become a problem however, if a delayed ACK would be kept waiting until all data is received, but Nagle's algorithm does not send out all the data yet, waiting for an ACK, resulting in a deadlock which resumes when a timeout is reached.\\
But we have not been able to reproduce this situation.
