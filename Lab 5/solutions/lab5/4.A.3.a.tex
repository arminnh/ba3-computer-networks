First packet: SYN \\
Second packet: SYN \& ACK \\
Third packet: ACK \\

The client sends the first packet, so a receival of a SYN packet by the server is interpreted as the beginning of a handshake, and thus a connection.\\
It is replied with a SYN-ACK packet, the client interprets this as the reply on its SYN.\\
At last, the client confirms the SYN-ACK with its ACK packet.
