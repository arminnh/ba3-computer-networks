On the tcptrace graph, the window size can be derived from the distance between the upper gray line and the lower gray line. The upper gray line shows the greatest sequence number the sender is allowed to send, given the ACKs it has received. The lower gray line shows the ACK number the sender has received, as we noted before. \\
We did, however, also include a graph of the window size itself, where we can clearly see that it stops increasing when the effect of the pings starts to kick in.
