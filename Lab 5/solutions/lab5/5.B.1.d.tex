The PSH and ACK flags are set.\\
The PSH is the push-flag and is used to tell the receiver to \textit{push} the data straight on the receiving socket, without waiting for the buffer to fill further.\\
The ACK is an acknowledgement of a previously received TCP packet, piggybacked on the telnet data packet. \\
