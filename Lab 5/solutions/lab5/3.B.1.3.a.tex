We do not observe fragmentation, TCP avoids fragmentation by setting the DF bit. \\

Additionally: \\
The MSS is negotiated in the three way handshake and determined by the minimum MTU value of the two pcs. We see in this case that the MSS is 460. \\
This size is respected by all of the packets in the nttcp transmission, so no fragmentation is needed.
