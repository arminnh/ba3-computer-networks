In the trace file (``Lab 5/traces/7.B.64kbps.pcap'') we see that packets sometimes are being retransmitted right after a duplicate acknowledgement, which is an indication that packet loss has occurred. Thus it doesn't seem unreasonable to assume that the sender performed a fast retransmit. Wireshark also indicates when it suspects a retransmisstion was a fast retransmit, and we do indeed see this happening.
