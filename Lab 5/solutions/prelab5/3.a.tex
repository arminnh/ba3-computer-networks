This is stored in the Maximum Segment Size parameter (MSS) he default TCP MSS is 536 bytes. Where a host wishes to set the MSS to another value, MSS is specified as a TCP option, in the first or second packet of the TCP handshake, depending on which side wants to make the change. \\
The maximum transmission unit (MTU) at the host is also brought into consideration: TCP will choose its MSS such that the packet size won't exceed the host's MTU, in a measure to avoid fragmentation.
