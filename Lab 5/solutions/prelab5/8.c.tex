Fast Retransmit reduces the time a sender waits before retransmitting a lost segment. When the ACK of the previously sent packet is received a certain number of times, we can assume that the subsequent packet was lost and retransmit is. As opposed to waiting for the timout timer to indicate the loss of a packet.\\
This increases the performance and works when there is a continuous flow of packets.
