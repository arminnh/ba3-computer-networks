According to RFC 6298:\\
- Until a round-trip time (RTT) measurement has been made for a segment sent between the sender and receiver, the sender SHOULD set RTO <- 1 second.\\
- When the first RTT measurement R is made, the host MUST set: \\
--- SRTT <- R\\
--- RTTVAR <- R/2\\
--- RTO <- SRTT + max (G, 4*RTTVAR)\\
- When a subsequent RTT measurement R' is made, a host MUST set:\\
--- RTTVAR <- (0.75) * RTTVAR + 0.25 * |SRTT - R'|\\
--- SRTT <- (0.875) * SRTT + 0.125 * R'\\
--- RTO <- SRTT + max (G, 4*RTTVAR)\\
- When RTO < 1 second => RTO is set to 1 second.\\
With G the clock granularity, defaulted on 6 seconds. Finer granularities (in the range of dozens of milliseconds) appear to perform better, at the cost of more overhead.
