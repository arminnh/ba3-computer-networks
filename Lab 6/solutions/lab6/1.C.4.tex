The ping command no longer works. This happens because the hosts are not on the same subnet anymore.
Every host/router connected to a bridge on a particular interface is supposed to be on the same IP
network on that interface. Because PC1 doesn't know about the network PC3 is on, and doesn't have a
default gateway either, it doesn't know where to send the ping message.
