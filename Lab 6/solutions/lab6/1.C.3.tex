If PC2 was configured as an IP router, it would be an IP hop with its own hardware
addresses and IP addresses, and it would decrease the TTL of packets. As such, the
TTL of the packet would be able to exceed at PC2, and PC2 would be able to send an
ICMP TTL exceeded error message. Upon receiving this error message, PC1 would know
of PC2's existance, and it would be added as hop on traceroute.
