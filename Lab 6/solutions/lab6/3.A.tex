PC1: 7 collisions \\
PC3: 12 collisions \\

Collisions happen when hosts try to send data simultaneously over the same shared channel.
The hub takes the signal and repeats it over the other links it is connected to.
If data is already being sent on one of those links, collisions occcur, because the hub will
just repeat both signals at the same time.
