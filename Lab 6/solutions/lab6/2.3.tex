** not sure **
It is not possible to issue the ping command to Router1 because the router is set up
to work on the data link layer, so it will not respond to ping commands.

Unless you have a L3 switch, your switch....can only be a switch. It only knows 1 network.
You can ping router to router because L2 works just fine through the switch and each
router is aware of the other network. You need a router in the middle to be a defalt
gateway for the switch if you want it to ping all networks . Search how to setup a router on a stick.
