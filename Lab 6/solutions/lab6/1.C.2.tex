traceroute to 10.0.1.31 (10.0.1.31), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets

The way traceroute works is by causing a time-to-live timeout at every intermediary IP hop. The
router where such a timeout happens sends an ICMP error packet back to the originator of the
packet that timed out. This is how the source knows about the hop. A bridge does not decrease
the TTL field of a packet, nor does it have an address from which it can send packets (as
discussed earlier).
