A switch/bridge connects different hosts to form a network. It works on the link layer, so it only looks up to the Ethernet header of a packet. Switches/bridges never analyze IP addresses, for instance. \\
A router works on the transport layer: It does IP routing, and connects different IP networks to each other.
