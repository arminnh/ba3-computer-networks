As explained in question 4, paths that form cycles will be stopped from existing. Once a bridge determines that a cycle exists, it will turn off one of the ports that form the cycle, breaking the cycle. Such a port is called a blocked port. A port in blocking state will never send any frames through the port, and discard any packets it receives from the port.
