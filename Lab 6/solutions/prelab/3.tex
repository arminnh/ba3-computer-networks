They are called transparent because their operation is transparent to the hosts they are connected to. It learns which hardware addresses are to be mapped to which interfaces just through the passing of packets on their way, never having to explicitly communicate to the hosts about wanting to learn where they are. If the bridge receives a packet with a destination hardware address it doesn't know yet, it just forwards it to all interfaces, like a hub does. Once the unkown host sends a packet of its own, the bridge saves its interface, and packets destined for that host won't have to be sent out to all interfaces anymore.
