A hub sends all incoming packets to all its outgoing interfaces and the host/router who can do somesthing with the packets will handle them.
A switch maps hardware addresses with one of its interfaces and checks to where a packet should be sent.
A switch is clearly more suitable for a high traffic network, as the hub will pollute all of its interfaces with duplicates of every packet,
