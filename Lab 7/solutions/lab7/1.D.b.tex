NAT could be used to change the source address of outgoing IP datagrams to the address of another host.
This can be done with a simple NAT rule that changes the source IP address on packets going to a certain host. \\

A way to prevent this could be the usage of encryption based on keys that are only present on trusted machines. \\
Another way could be to make the router block packets from outside a private network which have private addresses as source IP address.
