   DHCP uses UDP as its transport protocol.  DHCP messages from a client
   to a server are sent to the 'DHCP server' port (67), and DHCP
   messages from a server to a client are sent to the 'DHCP client' port
   (68). A server with multiple network address (e.g., a multi-homed
   host) MAY use any of its network addresses in outgoing DHCP messages.
