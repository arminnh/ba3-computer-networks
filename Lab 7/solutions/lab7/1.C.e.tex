For a packet from the inside destined to the outside, the port number (or other kinds
of identification, as mentioned, depends on the protocol) is mapped to the private
address of the host, in order to track the connection. The packet's source IP address
is then replaced by the router's outside IP address. Because of this, responses from
the outside will be directed towards the router. \\
When the router receives a packet from the outside, it looks up the port number or
ICMP identifier or ... (again, depends on the protocol) and, if found, translates the
packet's destination IP address field to the corresponding IP address.
