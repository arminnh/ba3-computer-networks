The client can broadcast DHCP packets with: \\
source hardware address: its own hardware address \\
source ip address: 0.0.0.0 \\

destination hardware address: ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff \\
destination ip address: 255.255.255.255 \\

The client can then be addressed/identified by the server, using the client's hardware address. \\
The DHCP server will know this address because of the client's broadcast message. \\
