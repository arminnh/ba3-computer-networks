Let's inspect some of the Offer packets that the server sent to PC1 and PC3.

Response to PC1:

\end{lstlisting}

Response to PC3: (as seen on PC2; the contents of the transport layer part of the packet seem to be unchanged after the packet passes the relay agent)
\begin{lstlisting}
Frame 2: 342 bytes on wire (2736 bits), 342 bytes captured (2736 bits) on interface 0
Ethernet II, Src: IntelCor_1a:7c:75 (68:05:ca:1a:7c:75), Dst: Cisco_f5:ff:4c (00:0e:83:f5:ff:4c)

User Datagram Protocol, Src Port: 67 (67), Dst Port: 67 (67)
Bootstrap Protocol (Offer)
    Message type: Boot Reply (2)
    Hardware type: Ethernet (0x01)
    Hardware address length: 6
    Hops: 1
    Transaction ID: 0xb0203025

    Option: (54) DHCP Server Identifier
    Option: (51) IP Address Lease Time
    Option: (1) Subnet Mask
    Option: (3) Router
    Option: (255) End
    Padding: 000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000...
\end{lstlisting}

The only differences to note (comparing the packets destined for PC3 to those for PC1) are that the IP address provided by the server is in subnet 10.0.3.0/24 instead of 10.0.2.0/24 (as it should be) and that the field ``Relay agent IP address'' is 10.0.3.1 instead of 0.0.0.0. \\
The structure and contents of ACK packets seem to be identical to the Offer packets in both cases.
