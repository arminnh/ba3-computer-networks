When the devices on your network broadcast a request for a DHCP server, they will accept the offer from the first DHCP server to reply.\\
When multiple DHCP servers are acting on the same network, the first to respond `wins' and this IP address is used by the client. It is possible to implement more complex load balancing between these DHCP servers, but this does not change anything at the clients' side.
