Section 3 (Private Address Space) lists the following blocks: \\

10.0.0.0        -   10.255.255.255  (10/8 prefix) \\
172.16.0.0      -   172.31.255.255  (172.16/12 prefix) \\
192.168.0.0     -   192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix) \\

If there were no blocks specified for private networks specifically (so private networks are allowed to use a network prefix that also exists publicly), there could be ambiguity as to whether a packet sent from within a private network is destined for a host in the private network or the public network.
