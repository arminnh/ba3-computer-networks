Because with NAT, inside a local network, many IP addresses can be used without conflicting with equal existing addresses.//
There are specific blocks dedicated for those private networks ( 192.168/16, 10/8, 172.16/12).
Everyone can use those in their own private network thanks to NAT.

the logical alternative is to just make more different IP addresses, which is exactly what ipv6 is doing.
