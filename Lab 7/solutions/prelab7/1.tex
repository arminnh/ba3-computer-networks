NAT is often mentioned as a solution to counteract the depletion of IP addresses on the global internet, because it allows different private networks to use the same IP addresses without creating conflicts between public networks. \\
There are specific blocks dedicated to those private networks (192.168/16, 10/8, 172.16/12). Everyone can use those in their own private network thanks to NAT. \\

An alternative to NAT is to just make more different IP addresses, which is exactly what IPv6 is doing.
