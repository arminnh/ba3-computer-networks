Since the tables are long (especially from the PCs) we haven't included them in the report, but they can be found at traces/4.C-9.*.out. \\

The output of the link state databases on the PCs can be found in the files ``Lab 4/traces/4.C-9.PC*.out''. Comparing the tables of the PCs to the those of the Cisco routers, we see that the output on the PCs shows some more information per entry in the table. The output on the PCs shows flags, length and more information about the links that the ``Link ID'' entries are connected to.

We can confirm that all of the tables are exactly the same, except for the Age column.
