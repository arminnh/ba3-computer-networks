We observed Request and Response messages. \\
Request:
\indent A RIP request packet is used to find routing information. A Request message sent by a node will trigger the sending of Response messages to the node by its neighbours. This message is usually sent on initialization of such a node.
    
Response:
\indent A RIP response packet contains routing information. Nodes which receive these packets can update their routing table if possible. Response messages can carry a whole routing table, or only entries queried for by a preceding Request message.

After a request message has been sent, response messages will be gratuitously sent when an update timer expires.
