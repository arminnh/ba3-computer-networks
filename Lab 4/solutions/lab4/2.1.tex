We notice here that in this packet there is information for two entries in the routing table.

Explanations:
\begin{lstlisting}
Routing Information Protocol
    Command: RIP command (request or response)
    Version: RIP version
    IP Address: IP address of a host to update the routing table, Metric: amount of internetwork hops to go through to get to the destination
        Address Family: the used address family. RIP can carry routing information for several different protocols (IP in this case).
        Route Tag: used to distinguish between internal and external routes
        IP Address: the IP address for the table entry
        Netmask: subnet mask for the table entry
        Next Hop: IP address of the next hop to which packets for the entry should be forwarded
        Metric: amount of internetwork hops to go through to get to the destination
