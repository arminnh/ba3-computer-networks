Network Mask: the subnet mask of the advertising OSPF node \\
Hello Interval: the interval at which OSPF Hello Packets are sent \\
Options: extra information about the local advertising node's capabilities \\
Router Priority: the priotity of the local node \\
Router Dead Interval: the death interval requested by the advertising node, describes how long to wait for hello packets before declaring the node dead \\
Designated Router: the ip address of the current designated router:  the routers in a network select a designated router and a backup designated router which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers.  \\
Backup Designated Router: the ip address of the current backup designated router \\
Active Neighbor: the router IDs of the OSPF router from which an OSPF Hello Packet has been seen on the network \\
