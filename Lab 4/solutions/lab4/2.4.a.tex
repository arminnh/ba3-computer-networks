We notice that in each "/Lab\ 4/traces/2-8.PC*.pcap" file, there is a RIPv2 Request from a PC to destination 224.0.0.9, followed by a RIPv2 Response from each router directly connected to the same PC with destination the IP address of that PC. \\
Afterwards, all destinations for RIPv2 packets have destination 224.0.0.9
