RIP is a distance vector routing protocol. OSPF is a link state routing protocol. \\
A distance vector routing algorithm will get the shortest path, while link state routing goes for the fastest path. \\

Distance vector: routing information is only exchanged between directly connected neighbors; a router cannot see beyond its own neighbors. \\
Link state: information is flooded throughout the link-state domain (an area in OSPF) to ensure all routers possess a synchronized copy of the area's link-state database.
