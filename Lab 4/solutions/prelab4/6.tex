To enable the processes, the user can edit the entries in /etc/quagga/daemons. \\
The processes can then be started/stopped with /etc/init.d/quagga {command}.
For each process, a configuration file in /etc/quagga (e.g. ripd.conf) can be edited (or created if there is no file) to configure routing algorithm parameters.
