Issue a ping to the non-existing IP address 111.111.111.111:\\
   \begin{lstlisting}  
    connect: Network is unreachable\\
\end{lstlisting}  
Issue a ping to the broadcast address 10.0.1.255 using the command:
\begin{lstlisting}  
    14:58:25.587269 IP 10.0.1.11 > 10.0.1.255: ICMP echo request, id 9803, seq 1, length 64
    14:58:26.588257 IP 10.0.1.11 > 10.0.1.255: ICMP echo request, id 9803, seq 2, length 64
\end{lstlisting}  
    There was no reply to the requests because every host on the network had the net.ipv4.icmp\_echo\_ignore\_broadcasts option enabled.\\
After disabling this with sysctl net.ipv4.icmp\_echo\_ignore\_broadcasts=0, we get the following output:
\begin{lstlisting}	  
	14:59:27.536259 IP 10.0.1.11 > 10.0.1.255: ICMP echo request, id 9805, seq 1, length 64

The three other hosts have responded.
