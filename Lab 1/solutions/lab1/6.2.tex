We expected the pings to 10.0.1.11 to go through the network (eth0), unlike the pings to 127.0.0.1, but we noticed they both went through the loopback interface.\\ 
We found this on the web:\\
    The loopback interface does not represent any actual hardware, 
    but exists so applications running on your computer can always connect 
    to servers on the same machine.\\

The local Ethernet interface is used for packets that are meant for other hosts.\\
The loopback interface is used by a computer to communicate to itself.
